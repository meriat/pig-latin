## How Pig Latin works

1. For words beginning with a vowel, add "way" to the end.

2. For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay".

3. If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!

4. For words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant.

## Specification

1. Input the string and check if it only has letters by using regex.

2. Start by dealing with the first letter being a vowel.

3. Then check for consonants also checking condition for "y"
